## **Hose Price Prediction Using 8 Different Regression Model**

### Dataset:
+ Boston Housing dataset is used for the training and testing all the models

### Data PreProcessing:
+ Data preprocessing has been done using the Pandas and Scikit-Learn

### All Regression Model Used:
+ Linear Regression
+ Neural Network Model
+ Ridge Regression
+ Lasso Regression
+ Support Vector Regressor
+ Decision Tree Regressor
+ Random Forest Regressor
+ Gradient Boosting Regressor

### Model Implementation:
+ Models are implemented using Pytorch(5 models) and Scikit-Lern(3 Models)

### Model Interpretation:
+ Features impact on the model output are visualize using the Shap Library

### Experiment Result:
+ All model except Support Vector Regressor are predicting the price  perfectly
+ The Random Forest Regressor Model Predict the most accurate price among all models.
